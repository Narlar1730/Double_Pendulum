#What to do
This is a simple simulation.
Just running the program as is will simply perform a double pendulum act.
I was debating adding some switches and other UI stuff in order to make the calculations possible from the home screen,
however due to many of the calculations taking several minutes this seemed redundant. So in order to determine what you
want the program to do, head into the 'Ball' Class, and find the list of boolean switches. That is all that you have to worry about.
Just flick on one of those bad boys and then exciting stuff will happen. It should be highlighted very clearly which ones to flick
within the comments.
