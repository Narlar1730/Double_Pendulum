Was written in java, in order to satisfy my assignment for ANU phys 3001 project 1. The formal report is available on request. If you want to refference me or my report, please feel free to contact me through Github.

Props to Evan and all my other physics buddies who were bloody champions at helping me with the maths and the code and other problems when I needed it. Y'all are top blokes.
